1. Go the Flash File Google Drive and Download it.
2. Go to your file library and extract it if you need to.
3. Open the Flash Emulator and click "Choose File"
4. Open your flash folder and choose whatever Game (.swf) you want to play.

Note: This can work with any .swf file you download.

If you are on personal devices, I recommend downloading flash games from archive.org
